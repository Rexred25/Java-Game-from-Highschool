# Java-Game-from-Highschool
A farming simulator I had made back in highschool using java

This game was made during my junior year of highschool in 2016.

Very basic, has sound, start menu, pause menu, had working walking animations at one point, doesnt appear to work anymore due to the fact that I had relied on ticks for the animations.

The game engine was provided by a friend, Ethan Zeigler.

The goal of the game was to farm potatoes in 4 different plots, and there was an enemy who would go around, and steal some of the harvest, so you had to beat the enemy in harvesting
to gain max yield. You could then spend your earned ptoatoes on upgrades.
